# information-fusion-using-belief-function-theory
More theoretical details of the framework can be found in the document.

## sumo_simulation
Two scenarios, namely the intersection and jaywalking are simulated to generate data. Such data will be given to framework for processing.

## bft_framework
The whole belief processing framework can be found in this repository. Besides belief processing framework, Interacting Multiple Model Kalman Filter is tested for comparison.
