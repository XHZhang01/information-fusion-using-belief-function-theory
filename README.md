# information-fusion-using-belief-function-theory
More theoretical details of the framework can be found in the document.

## bft_framework
The whole belief processing framework can be found in this repository. Besides belief processing framework, Interacting Multiple-Model Kalman Filter is tested for comparison.

## sumo_simulation
Two scenarios, namely the intersection and jaywalking are simulated to generate data. Such data will be given to framework for processing. Development of both results can be visualized with plots.

## procedure
Run the simulation and generate data
Place the data in the folder of the framework
Run the framwork to process the data
